SerialPort SDK is a professional Java serial port SDK. It provides a simple communication interface to connect any serial port devices.

* You can use it to implement or debug serial protocol. 
* You can send and capture data. 
* You can change communication channelâ€™s settings easily including the setting for non-standard baudrate.
* You can write Java code to automate some specific tasks.
* You can perform JavaScript to send command.


SerialPort SDK can be successfully used for:
* Interception and analysis of data transferring between any serial devices and Windows applications.
* Debugging any serial software or hardware.
* Development of serial peripheral hardware.
* Development of serial device drivers.
* Researching the functionality of any third-party software and hardware.
* Implementing, debugging or testing serial protocol between device and device driver.

SerialPort SDK can be used by:
* Software developers
* Hardware engineers
* Programmers
* Testers
* Science technicians
* Lab experts
* University students

This SDK includes the RXTX library.
